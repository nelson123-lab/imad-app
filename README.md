IMAD is a simple web application where backend connects to port 80 in local. Port 80 is a well-known port number used in computer networking to identify a specific communication endpoint, also known as a "port," for a specific service or application on a local network. In the context of the Internet Protocol (IP), which is the foundation of the modern Internet, port 80 is designated as the default port for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic, which is used for serving web pages over the World Wide Web.

When a computer runs a web server software, such as Apache or Nginx, it listens for incoming HTTP requests on port 80 by default. When a client, such as a web browser, sends an HTTP request to access a web page, it typically communicates with the web server using port 80. The web server then processes the request and returns the requested web page back to the client, which can be rendered and displayed in the web browser.

It's worth noting that port numbers are just numerical designations used by computers to route network traffic to the appropriate application or service. They have no inherent meaning or functionality beyond serving as an address for network communication. Port 80 is simply a well-known port that has been conventionally associated with HTTP traffic, but web servers can be configured to listen on other ports as well, if desired.
